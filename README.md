Setup Sentry With Docker 

Sentry-with-DockerYou can find the pem file I received at first on the server you opened on amazon. Here we first set up putty, which will provide us with communication with  Aws from the very beginning, and then installed docker in it. Then we installed docker-compose for the server, injected it into the final version,and finally we installed Sentry and ran the registration system. If you have any questions, you can contact me via Linkedin. And only the codes will be shared as separate files.I used putty in this project  because I thought the most convenient way to connect aws to ubuntu was putty. I will tell you about the Installation of Sentry using Docker on Ubuntu.
